# Ultrasonic NFT Art Generator

## How it works

An autonomous robot navigates through the environment while its ultrasonic sensor captures distance readings. These 200 samples are processed by a Python script that generates unique spiral art, where circle size and color are determined by distance values. Upon completion, ElevenLabs AI announces the creation, and the artwork is minted as an NFT on the Solana blockchain using Metaplex.
